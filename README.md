# DataGathererWindows
This is part of an effort to develop a lightweight C++ console application that interfaces with Windows to gather system info.
The idea behind this was to develop a proof of concept for a reporting agent that can gather information,
bundle it up into a SOAP/JSON package and send it to a listening service that will autopopulate tools.

This is still a work in progress and is very bare at the moment.
